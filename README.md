# Welcome to my "Hello World" Repository!

Greetings fellow coders! My name is Bentzy and I'm excited to share my first GitHub repository with you. This is where I'm practicing some basic coding skills and learning how to use Git and GitHub.

## What's in this repository?

Inside this repository, you'll find a single file: `hello.py`. This is a Python program that prints the classic "Hello World!" message to the console.

## How to use this repository

If you want to run the `hello.py` program yourself, all you need is Python 3 installed on your computer. Here's how to do it:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.
3. Type `python3 hello.py` and press enter.
4. You should see the "hello, world!" message printed to the console.
